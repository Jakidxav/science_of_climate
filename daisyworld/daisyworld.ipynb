    "Welcome to Daisyworld! This Notebook is modelled after a program called `daisy.m` written by Dennis Hartmann at the University of Washington. It models the computer simulation described in Watson and Lovelock, 1983, Biological homeostasis of the global environment: [The Parable of Daisyworld](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3402/tellusb.v35i4.14616), Tellus, 35B,  284-289.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daisyworld is a computer simulation that looks to show that the [Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) is plausible. That is, living organisms interact with their environment in a way that regulates and stabilizes that environment, thus perpetuating the conditions needed to support life on a planet. In this simulation, the only two kinds of living organisms are black and white daisies. White daisies have a high albedo and so reflect sunlight, while the black daisies absorb light and heat. We can then track how these two types of daisies compete for resources and affect the surface temeprature of the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this program, here are some useful variable explanations:\n",
    "- `area_w` is the areas covered by white daisies\n",
    "- `area_b` is the areas covered by black daisies\n",
    "- `area_g` is the remaining fertile ground not covered by daisies\n",
    "- `growth_rate_` is the growth rate of the black or white daisies\n",
    "- `death_rate` is the death rate of the daisies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this program, recall that emission temperature is calculated as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_e = (\\frac{S_0 (1 - \\alpha)}{\\sigma})^\\frac{1}{4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can get the emission temperature in degrees Celsius by subtracting ~273K. While calculations must be done in Kelvin, we will plot our output in degrees Celsius."

    "Before we run the actual method, we should first talk a little about [hysteresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis). Simply put, hysteresis is an effect lagging behind a cause in non-linear systems when that system's state is dependent on its history. Let's unpack that a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hysteresis pops up everywhere in science: physics, biology, atmospheric science. For instance, glacial meltwater from Greenland can affect the salt content (and therefore density profile) in the North Atlantic. This can trigger a shutdown of [AMOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation), or the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. This has huge implications for heat transport and deep water formation in the Arctic, and this is a function of how much fresh water has built up on the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean. Changes can be quick, and will only change back if enough salt has built back up in the North Atlantic (say from ice sheet formation and growth which would take up more fresh water). There is even evidence that this mechanism caused the [Younger Dryas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas), which shows how quick and drastic changes can occur in systems that exhibit hysteresis. Thus, we can say that AMOC exhibits hysteresis in that heat transport and deep water formation (its state) depends on how much freshwater there is at the surface of the North Atlantic (its history).\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind is that hysteresis is *path dependent*. That is to say, a system will exhibit different behavior and change based on how that system develops. So if we experiment with running lumosity backwards and forwards (increasing or decreasing), then we would expect black and white daisies to evolve in different ways. For instance, if we start at low lumosity, we would expect black daisies to grow first whereas if we start at a high value of lumosity white daisies will be first."
